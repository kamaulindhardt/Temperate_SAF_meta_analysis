# Temperate silvoarable agroforestry systematic mapping review
Current research on temperate silvoarable agroforestry and associated ecosystem services: A systematic mapping review

# Temperate silvoarable agroforestry meta-analysis
This research project, conducted by Wageningen University & Research, initially began as a systematic mapping review focusing on temperate silvoarable agroforestry and its associated ecosystem services. The study has since evolved into a comprehensive quantitative meta-analysis. Our current objective is to investigate the influence of various silvoarable agroforestry configurations on multiple ecosystem service outcomes.
